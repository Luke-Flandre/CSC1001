There's an instruction on how to run the code in my file.

For question 1, click the program 'q1'. Then input the flower's name, the number of petals of the flower and the price of the flowers. Please note that the name you input should be a string while the petals should be a positive integer and price should be a positive float number. The program will record it in the 'Flower' class and print each flower.

For question 2, click the program 'q2'. Input the polynomial you want to find its derivative. Note that the term should be in the form of "12*x^3" or "x^3" or "12*x". Also, the degree of the term should be a non-negative number.

For question 3, click the program 'q3'. Input the length of the river, the number of the fish and the number of the bears. Then, input how many steps you would like to stimulate. Thr program will then print each step of stimulation.
